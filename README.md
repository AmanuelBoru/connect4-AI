# connect4 AI
This is a python code that allows a player to play connect 4 with an AI using min max algorithm. A min max  is an optimization algorithm used in decision making and game theory. In a connect 4 game each board state has a given value calculated using a huristc function and recursive values from each possible move.Then the AI uses the values to make the best move. 

The program is made in a jupyter notebook environment but it can be run as a .py in any other environment.
